# code
- Semi-MVBGM.ipynb : code of Semi-MVBGM to produce TABLE I and Fig.8 of the manuscript (Jupyter Notebook)
- Semi-MVBGM.py : code of Semi-MVBGM to produce TABLE I and Fig.8 of the manuscript (Python3.7)
  *Note that the above codes do not produce exactly the same results as TABLE I and Fig.8 since prior distributions are randomly initialized by a multivariate normal distribution.
# data
